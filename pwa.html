    <h1>What Are Progressive Web Applications?</h1>
  </header>

  <section class="pwa-definition">
    <p>
      Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web-based applications that incorporate features traditionally associated with native apps. Powered by service workers and modern web technologies, PWAs can operate offline, send push notifications, update in the background, and provide near-instant load times (Warcholinski, 2024). By combining these capabilities, PWAs can deliver an app-like experience within a web browser, appealing to users who desire minimal device storage usage and developers who aim to simplify code maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to <em>InApp (2023)</em>, PWAs offer major advantages such as enhanced performance, reduced development cost, and data efficiency. These features particularly benefit businesses looking to target both emerging and developed markets without limiting their potential audience. Moreover, as indicated by <em>BigCommerce Team (2024)</em>, faster loading times can significantly reduce abandonment rates, which is often a major concern for mobile-driven applications.

  <section class="pwa-benefits">
    <h2>Key Benefits of PWAs</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> Utilizing service workers, PWAs store essential assets allowing users to access content even with limited or no connectivity (Warcholinski, 2024).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smaller Storage Footprint:</strong> Survey feedback consistently highlighted issues with native apps occupying too much storage (Anonymous survey, 2024). PWAs, by contrast, tend to be lightweight, reducing device strain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> With a single codebase, PWAs function across multiple operating systems and devices, allowing broader reach and easier maintenance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seamless Updates:</strong> Our survey also demonstrated displeasure with frequent, manual updates on native apps. PWAs update automatically in the background, saving user time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Load Times & Conversions:</strong> As <em>BigCommerce Team (2024)</em> notes, users are quick to abandon slow apps. PWAs heavily cache resources for rapid loading, thereby potentially boosting user satisfaction and conversion rates.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <section class="pwa-conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The problems revealed by both my survey and existing literature—ranging from sluggish app performance to constant update requirements—demonstrate the need for a new approach. PWAs stand out by bridging the divide between native and online solutions, granting users the best of both worlds. As a result, organizations planning for long-term digital strategies would benefit from adopting PWAs as cost-effective, user-friendly solutions that address common pain points seen in traditional web and native apps. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By focusing on features like offline support, minimal storage usage, and automatic updates, PWAs present a modern, inclusive, and highly accessible way to deliver content and services across diverse devices and network conditions.
